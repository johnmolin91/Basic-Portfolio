	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is John Molin and I am an up and coming web developer. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Mount Saint Mary College and am currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Languages I am currently working include html and css.

	I have a strong passion for coding. However, when I'm not doing that I'm usually playing sports, reading, watching movies, or listening to music. I enjoy learning and anything that gives me a new perspective on life. My favorite author is Malcolm Gladwell and my favorite movie is Memento.</p>
